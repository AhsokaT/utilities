## Description

**Note:** This was previously part of @sapphire/discord.js-utilities. It was split off into its own package to make it easier to maintain.

when sending messages through your bot you may sometimes want to send multiple pages of data, there are many types of cases where this may apply. To achieve this with as little overhead for yourself we provide this package with sensible defaults for sending a paginated message.

## Features

-   Written in TypeScript.
-   Bundled with esbuild to provide size-optimal bundles.
-   Offers CommonJS and ESM bundles.
-   Interaction based pagination (buttons and select menus)
-   Customizable pagination controls.
